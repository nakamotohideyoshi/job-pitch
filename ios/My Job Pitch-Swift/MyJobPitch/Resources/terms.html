<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>
<p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>

<h3>Purchases</h3>
<p>You are encouraged to familiarise yourself with your rights contained within the Sale of Goods Act 1979, Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999.</p>
<p>If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Service ("Purchase"), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your shipping information.</p>
<p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and complete. You expressly agree that Myjobpitch Limited is not responsible for any loss or damage arising from the submission of false or inaccurate information.</p>
<p>By submitting such information, you grant us the right to provide the information to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of Purchases.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for certain reasons including but not limited to: product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in your order or other reasons. You expressly agree that Myjobpitch Limited cannot accept any liability for loss or damage arising out of such cancellation.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorised or illegal transaction is suspected.</p>

<h3>Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies</h3>
<p>We are constantly updating our offerings of products and services on the Service. The products or services available on our Service may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable, and we may experience delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other web sites. You expressly agree that any such offer of a product or service does not constitute a legal offer capable of attracting legal consequences.</p>
<p>We cannot and do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information, including prices, product images, specifications, availability, and services. We reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice. Section "Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies" is without prejudice to existing statutory rights.</p>

<h3>Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions</h3>
<p>Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, "Promotions") made available through the Service may be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms. If you participate in any Promotions, please review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms and Conditions, the Promotion rules will apply. The terms and conditions of any other "Promotions" are independent of this agreement.</p>

<h3>Subscriptions</h3>
<p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Myjobpitch Limited cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Myjobpitch Limited customer support team.</p>
<p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Myjobpitch Limited with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Myjobpitch Limited to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
<p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Myjobpitch Limited will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>

<h3>Free Trial</h3>
<p>Myjobpitch Limited may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").</p>
<p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>
<p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by Myjobpitch Limited until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>
<p>At any time and without notice, Myjobpitch Limited reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>

<h3>Fee Changes</h3>
<p>Myjobpitch Limited, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
<p>Myjobpitch Limited will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
<p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>

<p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>
