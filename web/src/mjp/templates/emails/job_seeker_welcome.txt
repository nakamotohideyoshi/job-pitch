Hi {{ job_seeker.first_name }},

I wanted to drop you a line to welcome you to My Job Pitch and see if you have any questions I can help with?

Once you have recorded your up to 30-sec selfie video you will be matched to jobs and can easily swipe through job opportunities and apply.

Below is a link to a few example videos if you feel you need inspiration, however the key is to just be yourself. You can record on your phone pretty much anywhere, at home, on the bus or in a coffee shop it doesn’t matter, and you can re-record as many times as you want.

The platform saves recruiters massive amounts of time so we are also want to give back a bit to jobseekers!

Everyone that applies for at least 1 job will receive a £10 Amazon voucher*.

Here are some video pitch examples if you need inspiration:

Happy to answer any questions you might have.

Thanks
Mike
