    <h2>Cookie Policy </h2>
    <p>By using or accessing the Website, you are consenting to use of Cookies as follows:
    This policy helps to explain the occasions when and why cookies may be sent to visitors to the Website (referred to in this policy as “we”, “us” or “our”). “Cookies” are text-only pieces of information that a web site transfers to an individual’s hard drive or other web site-browsing equipment for record-keeping purposes. Cookies allow the Website to remember important information that will make your use of the site more convenient. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other value. Like most web sites, we use cookies for a variety of purposes in order to improve your online experience, for analytics and for marketing, but specifically we use Cookies on the Website for the following purposes:<br />
    Analytical Purposes: We use Cookies to analyze user activity in order to improve the Website. For example, using Cookies we can look at aggregate patterns like the average number of job searches that users perform. We can use such analysis to gain insights about how to improve the functionality and user experience of the Website.
    Your Preferences: We use Cookies to store certain user preferences on our Website. For example, we may store the recent searches you have performed in a Cookie so that we can allow you to easily repeat those searches when you return to our Website.
    Marketing: We use Cookies from third-party partners such as Google for marketing purposes. These Cookies allow us to display Myjobpitch.com promotional material to you on other sites you visit across the Internet.
    Referral Tracking: We use Cookies to associate user activity with the third party web site that referred the user to our Website. These third-party partner web sites receive credit for the activity of users they refer to our Website. We do not share any personal information or information about individual user activities with these partner entities. </p>
    <p>Session Cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the Website.  Persistent Cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). When we use session cookies to track the total number of visitors to our Website, this is done on an anonymous aggregate basis (as cookies do not in themselves carry any personal data). We may also employ cookies so that we remember your computer when it is used to return to the Website to help customize your Myjobpitch.com web experience. We may associate personal information with a cookie file in those instances. Use the options in your web browser if you do not wish to receive a cookie or if you wish to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. You can easily delete any cookies that have been installed in the cookie folder of your browser. For example, if you are using Microsoft Windows Explorer:
    Open ‘Windows Explorer’
    Click on the ‘Search’ button on the tool bar
    Type “cookie” into the search box for ‘Folders and Files’
    Select ‘My Computer’ in the ‘Look In’ box
    Click ‘Search Now’
    Double click on the folders that are found
    ‘Select’ any cookie file
    Hit the ‘Delete’ button on your keyboard
    If you are not using Microsoft Windows Explorer, then you should select “cookies” in the “Help” function for information on where to find your cookie folder.
